	Abstract = {Regression models for correlated binary outcomes are commonly fit using a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) methodology. GEE uses the Liang and Zeger sandwich estimator to produce unbiased standard error estimators for regression coefficients in large sample settings even when the covariance structure is misspecified. The sandwich estimator performs optimally in balanced designs when the number of participants is large, and there are few repeated measurements. The sandwich estimator is not without drawbacks; its asymptotic properties do not hold in small sample settings. In these situations, the sandwich estimator is biased downwards, underestimating the variances. In this project, a modified form for the sandwich estimator is proposed to correct this deficiency. The performance of this new sandwich estimator is compared to the traditional Liang and Zeger estimator as well as alternative forms proposed by Morel, Pan and Mancl and DeRouen. The performance of each estimator was assessed with 95{\%} coverage probabilities for the regression coefficient estimators using simulated data under various combinations of sample sizes and outcome prevalence values with an Independence (IND), Autoregressive (AR) and Compound Symmetry (CS) correlation structure. This research is motivated by investigations involving rare-event outcomes in aviation data.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of calculating power and sample size for tests based on generalized estimating equations (GEE), that arise in studies involving clustered or correlated data (e.g., longitudinal studies and sibling studies). Previous approaches approximate the power of such tests using the asymptotic behavior of the test statistics under fixed alternatives. We develop a more accurate approach in which the asymptotic behavior is studied under a sequence of local alternatives that converge to the null hypothesis at root-m rate, where m is the number of clusters. Based on this approach, explicit sample size formulae are derived for Wald and quasi-score test statistics in a variety of GEE settings. Simulation results show that in the important special case of logistic regression with exchangeable correlation structure, previous approaches can inflate the projected sample size (to obtain nominal 90{\%} power using the Wald statistic) by over 10{\%}, whereas the proposed approach provides an accuracy of around 2{\%}.},

@article{simulation13,
	Abstract = {Simulation studies allow researchers to answer specific questions about data analysis, statistical power, and best-practices for obtaining accurate results in empirical research. Despite the benefits that simulation research can provide, many researchers are unfamiliar with available tools for conducting their own simulation studies. The use of simulation studies need not be restricted to researchers with advanced skills in statistics and computer programming, and such methods can be implemented by researchers with a variety of abilities and interests. The present paper provides an introduction to methods used for running simulation studies using the R statistical programming environment and is written for individuals with minimal experience running simulation studies or using R. The paper describes the rationale and benefits of using simulations and introduces R functions relevant for many simulation studies. Three examples illustrate different applications for simulation studies, including (a) the use of simulations to answer a novel question about statistical analysis, (b) the use of simulations to estimate statistical power, and (c) the use of simulations to obtain confidence intervals of parameter estimates through bootstrapping. Results and fully annotated syntax from these examples are provided.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Data in medical sciences often have a hierarchical structure with lower level units (e.g. children) nested in higher level units (e.g. departments). Several specific but frequently studied settings, mainly in longitudinal and family research, involve a large number of units that tend to be quite small, with units containing only one element referred to as singletons. Regardless of sparseness, hierarchical data should be analyzed with appropriate methodology such as, for example linear‐mixed models. Using a simulation study, based on the structure of a data example on Ceftriaxone consumption in hospitalized children, we assess the impact of an increasing proportion of singletons (0--95\%), in data with a low, medium, or high intracluster correlation, on the stability of linear‐mixed models parameter estimates, confidence interval coverage and F test performance. Some techniques that are frequently used in the presence of singletons include ignoring clustering, dropping the singletons from the analysis and grouping the singletons into an artificial unit. We show that both the fixed and random effects estimates and their standard errors are stable in the presence of an increasing proportion of singletons. We demonstrate that ignoring clustering and dropping singletons should be avoided as they come with biased standard error estimates. Grouping the singletons into an artificial unit might be considered, although the linear‐mixed model performs better even when the proportion of singletons is high. We conclude that the linear‐mixed model is stable in the presence of singletons when both lower‐ and higher level sample sizes are fixed. In this setting, the use of remedial measures, such as ignoring clustering and grouping or removing singletons, should be dissuaded.},

 abstract = {To define a likelihood we have to specify the form of distribution of the observations, but to define a quasi-likelihood function we need only specify a relation between the mean and variance of the observations and the quasi-likelihood can then be used for estimation. For a one-parameter exponential family the log likelihood is the same as the quasi-likelihood and it follows that assuming a one-parameter exponential family is the weakest sort of distributional assumption that can be made. The Gauss-Newton method for calculating nonlinear least squares estimates generalizes easily to deal with maximum quasi-likelihood estimates, and a rearrangement of this produces a generalization of the method described by Nelder & Wedderburn (1972).},

 abstract = {This paper proposes an extension of generalized linear models to the analysis of longitudinal data. We introduce a class of estimating equations that give consistent estimates of the regression parameters and of their variance under mild assumptions about the time dependence. The estimating equations are derived without specifying the joint distribution of a subject's observations yet they reduce to the score equations for multivariate Gaussian outcomes. Asymptotic theory is presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases in which we assume independence, m-dependence and exchangeable correlation structures from each subject are discussed. Efficiency of the proposed estimators in two simple situations is considered. The approach is closely related to quasi-likelihood.},

 abstract = {Longitudinal data sets are comprised of repeated observations of an outcome and a set of covariates for each of many subjects. One objective of statistical analysis is to describe the marginal expectation of the outcome variable as a function of the covariates while accounting for the correlation among the repeated observations for a given subject. This paper proposes a unifying approach to such analysis for a variety of discrete and continuous outcomes. A class of generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for the regression parameters is proposed. The equations are extensions of those used in quasi-likelihood (Wedderburn, 1974, Biometrika 61, 439-447) methods. The GEEs have solutions which are consistent and asymptotically Gaussian even when the time dependence is misspecified as we often expect. A consistent variance estimate is presented. We illustrate the use of the GEE approach with longitudinal data from a study of the effect of mothers' stress on children's morbidity.},

 abstract = {Regression methods are considered for the analysis of correlated binary data when each binary observation may have its own covariates. It is argued that binary response models that condition on some or all binary responses in a given "block" are useful for studying certain types of dependencies, but not for the estimation of marginal response probabilities or pairwise correlations. Fully parametric approaches to these latter problems appear to be unduly complicated except in such special cases as the analysis of paired binary data. Hence, a generalized estimating equation approach is advocated for inference on response probabilities and correlations. Illustrations involving both small and large block sizes are provided.},

The response vector can comprise repeated observations on one variable, as in longitudinal studies or genetic studies of families, or can include observations for different variables. This paper discusses a class of models for the marginal expectations of each response and for pairwise associations. The marginal models are contrasted with log-linear models. Two generalized estimating equation approaches are compared for parameter estimation. The first focuses on the regression parameters; the second simultaneously estimates the regression and association parameters. The robustness and efficiency of each is discussed. The methods are illustrated with analyses of two data sets from public health research.},

In their generalized estimating equations (GEE), both Liang and Zeger (1986) and Prentice (1988) estimate the parameters associated with the expected value of an individual's vector of binary responses as well as the correlations between pairs of binary responses. In this paper, we discuss one-step estimators, i.e., estimators obtained from one step of the generalized estimating equations, and compare their performance to that of the fully iterated estimators in small samples. In simulations, we find the performance of the one-step estimator to be qualitatively similar to that of the fully iterated estimator. When the sample size is small and the association between binary responses is high, we recommend using the one-step estimator to circumvent convergence problems associated with the fully iterated GEE algorithm. Furthermore, we find the GEE methods to be more efficient than ordinary logistic regression with variance correction for estimating the effect of a time-varying covariate.},
