	Abstract = {Regression models for correlated binary outcomes are commonly fit using a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) methodology. GEE uses the Liang and Zeger sandwich estimator to produce unbiased standard error estimators for regression coefficients in large sample settings even when the covariance structure is misspecified. The sandwich estimator performs optimally in balanced designs when the number of participants is large, and there are few repeated measurements. The sandwich estimator is not without drawbacks; its asymptotic properties do not hold in small sample settings. In these situations, the sandwich estimator is biased downwards, underestimating the variances. In this project, a modified form for the sandwich estimator is proposed to correct this deficiency. The performance of this new sandwich estimator is compared to the traditional Liang and Zeger estimator as well as alternative forms proposed by Morel, Pan and Mancl and DeRouen. The performance of each estimator was assessed with 95{\%} coverage probabilities for the regression coefficient estimators using simulated data under various combinations of sample sizes and outcome prevalence values with an Independence (IND), Autoregressive (AR) and Compound Symmetry (CS) correlation structure. This research is motivated by investigations involving rare-event outcomes in aviation data.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of calculating power and sample size for tests based on generalized estimating equations (GEE), that arise in studies involving clustered or correlated data (e.g., longitudinal studies and sibling studies). Previous approaches approximate the power of such tests using the asymptotic behavior of the test statistics under fixed alternatives. We develop a more accurate approach in which the asymptotic behavior is studied under a sequence of local alternatives that converge to the null hypothesis at root-m rate, where m is the number of clusters. Based on this approach, explicit sample size formulae are derived for Wald and quasi-score test statistics in a variety of GEE settings. Simulation results show that in the important special case of logistic regression with exchangeable correlation structure, previous approaches can inflate the projected sample size (to obtain nominal 90{\%} power using the Wald statistic) by over 10{\%}, whereas the proposed approach provides an accuracy of around 2{\%}.},

	Abstract = {Simulation studies allow researchers to answer specific questions about data analysis, statistical power, and best-practices for obtaining accurate results in empirical research. Despite the benefits that simulation research can provide, many researchers are unfamiliar with available tools for conducting their own simulation studies. The use of simulation studies need not be restricted to researchers with advanced skills in statistics and computer programming, and such methods can be implemented by researchers with a variety of abilities and interests. The present paper provides an introduction to methods used for running simulation studies using the R statistical programming environment and is written for individuals with minimal experience running simulation studies or using R. The paper describes the rationale and benefits of using simulations and introduces R functions relevant for many simulation studies. Three examples illustrate different applications for simulation studies, including (a) the use of simulations to answer a novel question about statistical analysis, (b) the use of simulations to estimate statistical power, and (c) the use of simulations to obtain confidence intervals of parameter estimates through bootstrapping. Results and fully annotated syntax from these examples are provided.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Data in medical sciences often have a hierarchical structure with lower level units (e.g. children) nested in higher level units (e.g. departments). Several specific but frequently studied settings, mainly in longitudinal and family research, involve a large number of units that tend to be quite small, with units containing only one element referred to as singletons. Regardless of sparseness, hierarchical data should be analyzed with appropriate methodology such as, for example linear‐mixed models. Using a simulation study, based on the structure of a data example on Ceftriaxone consumption in hospitalized children, we assess the impact of an increasing proportion of singletons (0--95\%), in data with a low, medium, or high intracluster correlation, on the stability of linear‐mixed models parameter estimates, confidence interval coverage and F test performance. Some techniques that are frequently used in the presence of singletons include ignoring clustering, dropping the singletons from the analysis and grouping the singletons into an artificial unit. We show that both the fixed and random effects estimates and their standard errors are stable in the presence of an increasing proportion of singletons. We demonstrate that ignoring clustering and dropping singletons should be avoided as they come with biased standard error estimates. Grouping the singletons into an artificial unit might be considered, although the linear‐mixed model performs better even when the proportion of singletons is high. We conclude that the linear‐mixed model is stable in the presence of singletons when both lower‐ and higher level sample sizes are fixed. In this setting, the use of remedial measures, such as ignoring clustering and grouping or removing singletons, should be dissuaded.},

 abstract = {To define a likelihood we have to specify the form of distribution of the observations, but to define a quasi-likelihood function we need only specify a relation between the mean and variance of the observations and the quasi-likelihood can then be used for estimation. For a one-parameter exponential family the log likelihood is the same as the quasi-likelihood and it follows that assuming a one-parameter exponential family is the weakest sort of distributional assumption that can be made. The Gauss-Newton method for calculating nonlinear least squares estimates generalizes easily to deal with maximum quasi-likelihood estimates, and a rearrangement of this produces a generalization of the method described by Nelder & Wedderburn (1972).},

Asymptotic theory is presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases in which we assume independence, m-dependence and exchangeable correlation structures from each subject are discussed. Efficiency of the proposed estimators in two simple situations is considered. The approach is closely related to quasi-likelihood.},

 abstract = {Longitudinal data sets are comprised of repeated observations of an outcome and a set of covariates for each of many subjects. One objective of statistical analysis is to describe the marginal expectation of the outcome variable as a function of the covariates while accounting for the correlation among the repeated observations for a given subject. This paper proposes a unifying approach to such analysis for a variety of discrete and continuous outcomes. A class of generalized estimating equations (GEEs) for the regression parameters is proposed. The equations are extensions of those used in quasi-likelihood (Wedderburn, 1974, Biometrika 61, 439-447) methods. The GEEs have solutions which are consistent and asymptotically Gaussian even when the time dependence is misspecified as we often expect. A consistent variance estimate is presented. We illustrate the use of the GEE approach with longitudinal data from a study of the effect of mothers' stress on children's morbidity.},

It is argued that binary response models that condition on some or all binary responses in a given "block" are useful for studying certain types of dependencies, but not for the estimation of marginal response probabilities or pairwise correlations. Fully parametric approaches to these latter problems appear to be unduly complicated except in such special cases as the analysis of paired binary data. Hence, a generalized estimating equation approach is advocated for inference on response probabilities and correlations. Illustrations involving both small and large block sizes are provided.},

The response vector can comprise repeated observations on one variable, as in longitudinal studies or genetic studies of families, or can include observations for different variables. This paper discusses a class of models for the marginal expectations of each response and for pairwise associations. The marginal models are contrasted with log-linear models. Two generalized estimating equation approaches are compared for parameter estimation. The first focuses on the regression parameters; the second simultaneously estimates the regression and association parameters. The robustness and efficiency of each is discussed.

In their generalized estimating equations (GEE), both Liang and Zeger (1986) and Prentice (1988) estimate the parameters associated with the expected value of an individual's vector of binary responses as well as the correlations between pairs of binary responses. In this paper, we discuss one-step estimators, i.e., estimators obtained from one step of the generalized estimating equations, and compare their performance to that of the fully iterated estimators in small samples. In simulations, we find the performance of the one-step estimator to be qualitatively similar to that of the fully iterated estimator. When the sample size is small and the association between binary responses is high, we recommend using the one-step estimator to circumvent convergence problems associated with the fully iterated GEE algorithm. Furthermore, we find the GEE methods to be more efficient than ordinary logistic regression with variance correction for estimating the effect of a time-varying covariate.},

abstract = {Summary The Wilcoxon rank sum test is widely used for two‐group comparisons for nonnormal data. An assumption of this test is independence of sampling units both between and within groups. In ophthalmology, data are often collected on two eyes of an individual, which are highly correlated. In ophthalmological clinical trials, randomization is usually performed at the subject level, but the unit of analysis is the eye. If the eye is used as the unit of analysis, then a modification to the usual Wilcoxon rank sum variance formula must be made to account for the within‐cluster dependence. For some clustered data designs, where the unit of analysis is the subunit, group membership may be defined at the subunit level. For example, in some randomized ophthalmologic clinical trials, different treatments may be applied to fellow eyes of some patients, while the same treatment may be applied to fellow eyes of other patients. In general, binary eye‐specific covariates may be present (scored as exposed or unexposed) and one wishes to compare nonnormally distributed outcomes between exposed and unexposed eyes using the Wilcoxon rank sum test while accounting for the clustering. In this article, we present a corrected variance formula for the Wilcoxon rank sum statistic in the setting of eye (subunit)‐specific covariates. We apply it to compare ocular itching scores in ocular allergy patients between eyes treated with active versus placebo eye drops, where some patients receive the same eye drop in both eyes, while other patients receive different eye drops in fellow eyes. We also present comparisons between the clustered Wilcoxon test and each of the signed rank tests and mixed model approaches and show dramatic differences in power in favor of the clustered Wilcoxon test for some designs.}

    abstract = { Many diagnostic imaging experiments are characterized by the presence of several observations for each patient studied. Evaluation of metastases with different imaging modalities in patients with cancer or examination of multiple artery segments in patients with heart abnormalities are some examples of such studies. Data obtained from multiple observations per patient are cluster correlated and should not be analyzed by using standard statistical methods because of correlations within a subject. In this article, positron emission tomographic studies are used as a framework to review statistical methods for the analysis of clustered data. Some simple statistical methods that account for correlation within a subject and that can be applied to conventional and well-known statistical methods, such as the χ2 and t tests, are introduced. One of these methods is illustrated by using a brief analysis of data from a positron emission tomographic study, which demonstrates how resulting conclusions may be incorrect if appropriate techniques are not applied. Alternative methods that can handle multiple observations and dependency within a subject for diagnostic imaging studies are discussed. }

abstract = {Abstract The Mann–Whitney U‐test is ubiquitous in statistical practice for the comparison of measures of location for two samples where the assumption of normality is questionable. Frequently, one has replicate data for each individual in a group and would like to compare measures of central tendency between groups without assuming normality. For this purpose, we present a generalization of the Mann–Whitney U‐test for clustered data. The test is performed by computing zc=(Wc−μc)/σc, ∼N(0,1) under H0, where Wc, μc are the observed and expected Mann–Whitney U‐statistic based on a comparison of all pairs of replicates in the two groups and σc is the standard deviation of Wc that is modified to account for clustering effects within a cluster. We obtain an explicit variance formula that is a function of four clustering parameters. We validate the properties of the test procedure in a simulation study. We illustrate the methods with an example comparing the baseline Humphrey visual field between two treatment groups in a randomized clinical trial of patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP).

abstract = {Summary.  The Wilcoxon rank sum test is frequently used in statistical practice for the comparison of measures of location when the underlying distributions are far from normal or not known in advance. An assumption of the ordinary rank sum test is that individual sampling units are independent. In many ophthalmologic clinical trials, the Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Scale (ETDRS) is a principal endpoint used for measuring the level of diabetic retinopathy. This is an ordinal scale, and it is natural to consider the Wilcoxon rank sum test for the comparison of the level of diabetic retinopathy between treatment groups. However, under this design, unlike the usual Wilcoxon rank sum test, the subject is the unit of randomization, but the eye is the unit of analysis. Furthermore, a person will tend to have different, but correlated, ETDRS scores for fellow eyes. Thus, we propose a correction to the variance of the Wilcoxon rank sum statistic that accounts for clustering effects and that can be used for both balanced (same number of subunits per cluster) or unbalanced (different number of subunits per cluster) data, both in the presence or absence of ties, with p‐value adjusted accordingly. In this article, we present large‐sample theory and simulation results for this test procedure and apply it to diabetic retinopathy data from type I diabetics in the Sorbinil Retinopathy Trial.}

abstract = {Summary The Wilcoxon signed rank test is a frequently used nonparametric test for paired data (e.g., consisting of pre‐ and posttreatment measurements) based on independent units of analysis. This test cannot be used for paired comparisons arising from clustered data (e.g., if paired comparisons are available for each of two eyes of an individual). To incorporate clustering, a generalization of the randomization test formulation for the signed rank test is proposed, where the unit of randomization is at the cluster level (e.g., person), while the individual paired units of analysis are at the subunit within cluster level (e.g., eye within person). An adjusted variance estimate of the signed rank test statistic is then derived, which can be used for either balanced (same number of subunits per cluster) or unbalanced (different number of subunits per cluster) data, with an exchangeable correlation structure, with or without tied values. The resulting test statistic is shown to be asymptotically normal as the number of clusters becomes large, if the cluster size is bounded. Simulation studies are performed based on simulating correlated ranked data from a signed log‐normal distribution. These studies indicate appropriate type I error for data sets with ≥20 clusters and a superior power profile compared with either the ordinary signed rank test based on the average cluster difference score or the multivariate signed rank test of Puri and Sen (1971, Nonparametric Methods in Multivariate Analysis, New York: John Wiley). Finally, the methods are illustrated with two data sets, (i) an ophthalmologic data set involving a comparison of electroretinogram (ERG) data in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients before and after undergoing an experimental surgical procedure, and (ii) a nutritional data set based on a randomized prospective study of nutritional supplements in RP patients where vitamin E intake outside of study capsules is compared before and after randomization to monitor compliance with nutritional protocols.}

abstract = {Summary We consider the problem of comparing two outcome measures when the pairs are clustered. Using the general principle of within‐cluster resampling, we obtain a novel signed‐rank test for clustered paired data. We show by a simple informative cluster size simulation model that only our test maintains the correct size under a null hypothesis of marginal symmetry compared to four other existing signed rank tests; further, our test has adequate power when cluster size is noninformative. In general, cluster size is informative if the distribution of pair‐wise differences within a cluster depends on the cluster size. An application of our method to testing radiation toxicity trend is presented.}
